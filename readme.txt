Fix : send Middle and Right Click
MSDN : https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms644986(v=vs.85).aspx
The hook procedure should process a message in less time than the data entry specified in the LowLevelHooksTimeout value in the following registry key:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop
The value is in milliseconds. If the hook procedure times out, the system passes the message to the next hook.  <---
However, on Windows 7 and later, the hook is silently removed without being called.
There is no way for the application to know whether the hook is removed.
==> Use thread to send Middle and Right Click so that the function is faster than LowLevelHooksTimeout
    (and change LowLevelHooksTimeout in Windows 10 has no effect ???)
==> Send Open Windows Explorer by Thread

Test : OK with SmartGesture_Win10_64_VER409 http://dlcdnet.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/Apps_for_Win10/SmartGesture/SmartGesture_Win10_64_VER409.zip?_ga=2.172942123.962806994.1504290823-185335011.1500703387
     : NOK with 4.0.17 (not ok with : Backward / Forward (3 fingers swipe left / right) beacause Smart Gesture Send other key)
